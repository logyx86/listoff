Please help me test my new app so I can publish it to Google Play. Test mine and I'll test yours ;)

I've created a simply app to create and share lists (shopping list, to-do list, etc). Please help me to get it published by downloading and installing my ListOFF app and test it for at least 14 days.
Also, leave feedback so we can keep improving our app to make it more enjoyable for our users and give them a better experience.

Thank you much in advance. Please leave a message in the group and I will test your app back :)
